# Pre-Requisites

Ensure the following are installed before running this application:-

1) Node JS ( Refer:- https://nodejs.org/en/download/ )
2) React JS ( Refer:- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

# Getting started

Perform the following steps to ensure smooth flow of this project:-

1) Navigate to "backend" folder, open terminal and type "npm init" and then "npm install".
2) To run the back end APIs alone, run "npm start", a console log message will appear in the terminal stating that the application is live on "http://localhost:3002". This is configurable in "backend/config.js" under the variable "environmentDetails".

3) To run the APIs, you may import the postman collection file "Apoxeo.postman_collection.json", all the test cases will be present.

4) If you would like to check out the front end application too, navigate to "frontend" folder, open terminal and type "npm init" and then "npm install".

5) Run the frontend application by typing "npm start", the application will automatically open in browser under the URL "http://localhost:3000". If not, type this URL manually in the browser and run it.

6) Please note that the front end application is not fully complete and was taken under lesser priority since the UI binding wasn't the task.
